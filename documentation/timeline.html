<h1> Timeline </h1>


<p><b>February 21, 2010</b><br>
Set up Qt program, with a network listener. I am able to connect to the server
and receive data from it.<br>

<p><b>February 27, 2010</b><br>
First tests with the client and server. I created several nodes, and broadcasted
changes in their position and text, so that when one client types something or 
moves a node, the other client sees it.<br>

<p><b>March 1, 2010</b><br>
Wrote a parser that interprets what people have typed, and generates a graph
based on what was typed.<br>

<p><b>March 5, 2010</b><br>
Removed threads from the network listener. My program was segfaulting for unknown reasons,
and removing the threads seems to have fixed things.<br>

<p><b>March 6, 2010</b><br>
Added spring system. Nodes now crudely rearrange themselves to form a 
least energy state.<br>

<p><b>March 14, 2010</b><br>
Fixed a bunch of bugs in the server communication. I spent a lot of time
coordinating with Mischa so that the server sends things reliably, and 
without duplicate messages.<br>

<p><b>March 30, 2010</b><br>
Added zooming system. One of the harder parts of this system was to reposition 
both the view of the graph and the cursor.  Getting the proper positions of
thins is complicated when widgets are inside of widgets, inside of windows, 
each with its own coordinate system. It's mainly working as I had hoped, though
the zooming is a bit aggressive at times. <br>

<p><b>April 1, 2010</b><br>
I put a lot of work into the spring system, and now it seems to work as I would like.<br>

<p><b>April 2, 2010</b><br>
Replaced for loops accessing data by indices (my_vectore[0]) with iterators ((*it)->data()), after reading Accelerated
C++, a very good book.<br>

<p><b>April 4, 2010</b><br>
Added names to the nodes, so that people know who made each node. Brilliant!<br>

<p><b>April 6, 2010</b><br>
I broke my code. Bad. I had to revert to a previous subversion commit. 
Things were segfaulting everywhere.<br>

<p><b>April 7, 2010</b><br>
Fixed the mystery segfaults. It turns out they were caused because I was 
returning my std::vectors
as copies, not as const refs (const &). This meant that when I was iterating 
over a vector, I would set up the iterators using <em>different</em> vectors!
In other words for(std::vector<Tete*>::const_iterator it = getVect().begin();
it != getVect().end(); ++it), .begin() and .end() belonged to DIFFERENT
vectors!y<br>

<p><b>April 9, 2010</b><br>
First tests with accessing outside chats (AIM, Google Talk, Facebook)  with my client.  
It seems too hard 
to wrap the libpurple library in Perl, so I'm using a script called Purpled, 
and talking to it over telnet. I can receive messages from AIM, Google Chat, 
and Facebook, though I still need to write more code for the client to use
this feature.<br>

<p><b>April 11, 2010</b><br>
More work on ChatListener and outside chat system.<br>

<p><b>April 13, 2010</b><br>
Removed some code I had put in place to limit the amount of traffic I sent to the server,
in an effort to improve performance.<br>

<p><b>April 15, 2010</b><br>
Added ChatListener box, and associated menu and protocol expansions. In a test I was
able to connect to AIM and Google Chat through my client, and receive new messages.<br>

<p><b>April 17, 2010</b><br>
Fixed longstanding performance bug. It was caused when I would convert a 
text display box to a text edit box (with blinking cursor, cut and paste). When 
I would convert that same box <em>back</em> to a text display box, resources were
still being hogged. My solution involves deleting the text edit box, and creating a new
text display box in its place.
Also tweaked the spring system.  It still doesn't work perfectly<br>

<p><b>April 18, 2010</b><br>
Changed renderer to OpenGL, this makes things run considerably faster, though
text looks worse, especially on Windows.<br>

<p><b>April 19, 2010</b><br>
User name now defaults to John Doe<br>

<p><b>April 20, 2010</b><br>
Added settings menu, so that users can disable the background gradient, the 
spring system, and the zooming if they find things annoying or if it runs 
too slowly.<br>

<p><b>April 21, 2010</b><br>
Added node dragging, and added ability to print the display for (my?) future reference.<br> 

<p><b>April 22, 2010</b><br>
User can now create a link by clicking on a node, then clicking on a second node.<br>

<p><b>April 24, 2010</b><br>
Created icons for both OS X and Windows. Windows proved to be more difficult
since I was limited to 32x32 pixels. Added an activity marker, that indicates where
the next node you create will be connected to.  Without the marker it seems like
your node gets added to an arbitrary node.
Removed TimerEvents from my code. This was causing a major performance bug: with 50 - 100
on screen, that's 50-100 separate event callbacks 20 times per second, which was causing things to run very 
slowly. <br>

<p><b>April 26, 2010</b><br>
Added a background gradient to make the application look less stark and white.
Fixed a bug on the Windows client where text looked really blurry, thanks 
to a post on the Qt forum.
Added UsersView side bar. At the moment it's like a buddy list, but I set it 
up so that it can display connections between people, or other neat looking
visualizations.
I also got rid of the blurry gradient showing activity, and replaced it with a
circle.<br>

<p><b>April 27, 2010</b><br>
Each user is assigned a random color on startup, so that if they neglect 
to choose a color it's black. <br>

<p><b>May 2, 2010</b><br>
Put the physics system in its own thread. Things now run a lot smoother. Now that the
spring system doesn't have to run in 1/20th of a second, I tweaked the spring system
so that it runs smoother and explodes less often. Fixed a bug where the link
wasn't drawing: it was due to not setting the correct bounding box size for the 
item.<br>


<p><b>May 5, 2010</b><br>
Made the "Set Color" and "Set Name" windows pop up automatically when the application starts
up.
Fixed a few bugs involving the keyboard focus not being on the main window when
the application stats up, meaning you don't have to click on the window first.
Also made the screen continuously refresh (bad for performance, but looks better), items not redrawing at the right time
was a longstanding bug.
Created Eliza in Perl using a module from CPAN, and a generic DOCTOR script found on the
web. This allowed me to rapidly test several issues that pop up while people
are talking. Added word wrapping to chat lines, 25 minutes before starting 
my presentation. <br>
