<h1> Kaleidoscope Chat Program </h1>

project manager Patrick Tierney,  ptierney<br>

<P>Internet based chat has remained essentially unchanged since the 1980s.
Chat programs developed in the past several years such as Skype and Second Life 
still resort to text-based chatting, despite advancements in voice communication,  
video streaming, and graphics technology.
While text-based chatting is often adequate for short conversations, 
it fails to organize the branching and recirculating threads that form in longer conversation,
while producing chat records that are hard to read, 
especially in chat rooms with several interlaced conversations.
My chat program offers a new way to communicating on Internet:
people chat in two dimensions in a self-organizing graph structure.
This system achieves two things.
First, it supports an unlimited number of simultaneous conversation
without introducing interlaced text, all while remaining
unified as a single chat.
Secondly, because the conversation is constantly self-organizing, 
conversations can grow in complexity while retaining clarity,
and old chats can be easily read in the future;
threads, branches, and important nodes can be easily spotted <em>visually</em> by 
their spatial arrangement,
with no extra work.
Chatting with one dimensional text messages has needed a replacement for some time. 
As Internet conversations become
increasingly widespread, 
especially in work environments, 
and the information generated becomes 
increasingly important, 
these conversations should take place in environment that
organized information
and adapts to the non-linear structure of conversations,
an environment that embraces complex conversations, not hinders them. 
Kaleidoscope chat does just that.
